<ul><li><h1>Minecraft Mods<h1></li></ul>
    The first Minecraft mods worked by decompiling and modifying the Java source code of the game. The original version of the game, now called Minecraft: Java Edition, is still modded this way, but with more advanced tools. Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, a version of the game available for mobile, consoles, and Microsoft Windows, is written in C++,<br> and as a result cannot be modded the same way. Instead, modders must use "add-ons" written in a scripting language to add content</p>
